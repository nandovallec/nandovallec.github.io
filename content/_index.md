        Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate at Simula Research Laboratory working on LLM-Based Automatic Software Improvementâ€”teaching large language models to detect bugs, refactor code, and optimize performance with minimal human guidance. My goal is to make software engineering faster, safer, and more sustainable.

        I build practical ML systems informed by a global journey through Spain, the U.S., Germany, Sweden, and Japan, and Iâ€™m especially curious about the intersection of AI and cybersecurity: secure-by-default code generation, anomaly detection in CI/CD, and trustworthy tooling for developers.

        What Iâ€™m exploring now:

        - Self-refining agents for code repair and performance tuning
        - Robust evaluation of AI-generated patches (correctness, security, maintainability)
        - Data pipelines for code intelligence (mining repos, tracing, and feedback loops)
        - Privacy-preserving and safety-first practices for AI in software development

        If youâ€™re working on developer tools, secure AI, or code intelligence, letâ€™s talk and collaborate ðŸ˜ƒ
