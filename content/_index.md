        Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate at Simula Research Laboratory working on LLM-Based Automatic Software Improvement. In other words, how to teach large language models to detect bugs, refactor code, and optimize performance with minimal human guidance. My goal is to make software engineering faster, safer, and more sustainable.

        Having lived in Spain, the United States, Germany, Sweden, and Japan, I brings a global perspective to building practical ML systems.

        What Iâ€™m exploring now
        - Self-refining agents for code repair and performance tuning
        - Robust evaluation of AI-generated patches (correctness, security, maintainability)
        - Data pipelines for code intelligence (mining repos, tracing, and feedback loops)
        - New approaches for code generation.

        If youâ€™re working on code agents, developer tools, secure AI, or code intelligence, letâ€™s talk and collaborate ðŸ˜ƒ
