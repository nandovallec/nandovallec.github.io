abstract: With software maintenance accounting for 50% of the cost of developing software,
  enhancing code quality and reliability has become more critical than ever. In response
  to this challenge, this doctoral research proposal aims to explore innovative solutions
  by focusing on the deployment of agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs)
  to perform software maintenance tasks. The iterative nature of agents, which allows
  for continuous learning and adaptation, can help surpass common challenges in code
  generation. One distinct challenge is the last-mile problems, errors at the final
  stage of producing functionally and contextually relevant code. Furthermore, this
  project aims to surpass the inherent limitations of current LLMs in source code
  through a collaborative framework where agents can correct and learn from each other's
  errors. We aim to use the iterative feedback in these systems to further fine-tune
  the LLMs underlying the agents, becoming better aligned to the task of automated
  software improvement. Our main goal is to achieve a leap forward in the field of
  automatic software improvement by developing new tools and frameworks that can enhance
  the efficiency and reliability of software development.
