abstract: >
  Research shows that grammatical mistakes in a sentence can be corrected by translating it
  to another language and back using neural machine translation with language models.
  We investigate whether this correction capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) extends
  to Automatic Program Repair (APR). Current generative models for APR are pre-trained on
  source code and fine-tuned for repair. This paper proposes bypassing the fine-tuning step
  and using Round-Trip Translation (RTT): translation of code from one programming language
  to another programming or natural language, and back. We hypothesize that RTT with LLMs
  restores the most commonly seen patterns in code during pre-training, i.e., performs a
  regression toward the mean, which removes bugs as they are a form of noise with respect
  to the more frequent, natural, bug-free code in the training data. To test this hypothesis,
  we employ eight recent LLMs pre-trained on code, including the latest GPT versions, and
  four common program repair benchmarks in Java. We find that RTT with English as an
  intermediate language repaired 101 of 164 bugs with GPT-4 on the HumanEval-Java dataset.
  Moreover, 46 of these are unique bugs that are not repaired by other LLMs fine-tuned for
  APR. Our findings highlight the viability of round-trip translation with LLMs as a
  technique for automated program repair and its potential for research in software
  engineering.
